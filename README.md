# Airbnb-Booking-Analysis-Capstone-Project

* Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to
expand travelling possibilities.

* Today, Airbnb has become a one-of-a-kind service
that is used and recognized by the whole world and
generates a lot of data.

* Data that can be analyzed and used for security,
business decisions, understanding of customers' and
providers' (hosts) behaviour and performance on the
platform, guiding marketing initiatives,
implementation of innovative additional services
and much more.
